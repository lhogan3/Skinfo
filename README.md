# **Skinfo**
iOS Project for UVM CS295 developed by Liam Hogan, Danna Don, Olivia Myrick, and Max Peck

## About Skinfo
* **UVMSSC Mountains:** Skinfo includes a list of ski areas that are offered as pass options to members of the UVM Ski and Snowboard Club.  These mountains include Bolton Valley, Jay Peak, Smuggler's Notch, Mad River Glen, Sugarbush, and Stowe.
* **Basic Ski Area Info:** This application will display basic data about each ski area, such as the address, the trail count, hours of operation, and the ticket price.
* **Live Weather Data:** Skinfo will display live weather data provided by Dark Sky.

## Testing Instructions
* **Target Device:** Skinfo will run best on the iPhone 11 Pro Max, due to its large size and plentiful screen real estate.  Although each design element is constrained within the view of all devices, the large display of the 11 Pro Max allows for better spacing and no lost content.

## References
* **SQLite.swift:** Skinfo was developed to work with a SQLite database, which was made possible with the use of the [SQLite.swift](github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift) "language layer" provided by Stephen Celis on GitHub.  This language layer project allowed for easier interaction with the database file storing all static data in Skinfo.
